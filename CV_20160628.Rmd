    - Data set: concentration of 3 biomarkers in serum and fibrosis stages (F0, F1, F2, F3 and F4) of 600 samples.
    - Target: classification of liver fibrosis stage by 3 biomarkers.
    - Algorithm: Adaboost.
    - Method: 
        1. Made the first adaboost model with training data which is 80% of samples labeled as "F4" and "non-F4".
        2. Made the second adaboost model with training data which is 80% of samples labeled as "F0" and "non-F0".
        3. Made the third adaboost model only with the data whose fibrosis stage were F1~F3, and re-labled as "F1" and "non-F1".
        4. Made the 4th adaboost model which only can distinguish F2 and F3.
        5. Classified samples with 3 biomarkers by models mentioned above in sequence from the first one to the 4th one.
